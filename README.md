# LearnGuitar

A Python application that serves as an interactive learning tool for people wanting to learn the guitar. It provides a quiz format where users can test their knowledge of the guitar fretboard or the different chords and their positions on this fretboard. The program generates random chord questions, prompting users to identify the correct notes for given chords. The graphical interface includes a virtual guitar fretboard display, buttons for actions like generating new questions, and an entry field for users to input their answers. Users can choose between major and minor chords and explore different chord types, including major, minor, diminished, augmented, 7ths, sus2, and sus4. The application also features a "Peak" button, revealing note labels on the fretboard for educational purposes.
